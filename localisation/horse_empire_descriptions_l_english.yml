START_SCREEN_united_equestria:0 "Leading up towards the beginning of the 21st century, Equestria was in a time of great strife. The Changelings, once thought to be long dead or forgotten, emerged from their hiding in the Badlands and swarmed the nation. Towns that had been left long undefended were attacked within days and many ponies were abducted or even killed in the initial attack. At the head of this invasion was Queen Chrysalis, back with a vengeance after her many defeats at the hands of Celestia and the Elements of Harmony. To top all of this off, Queen Umbra who had been believed to be killed, had returned with a vengeance, taking over the Crystal City once more and invading Equestria alongside Chrysalis.\n\nThe war was a long and hard fought battle, many lives were lost on both sides, but eventually, harmony and friendship overcame all odds. Near the end of the war, when Equestria had pushed back both Umbra and Chrysalis to whatever tiny remnants of their original empires they once had, Celestia, along with Luna and Twilight Sparkle, brought the Elements of Harmony to bare against the two villians. The three alicorns working in tandem over-charged the elements to once and for all get rid of Umbra and Chrysalis, and it nearly cost them their lives in the process.\n\nIn a great flash of light, what had remained of the Dark Imperator and the Hive Queen's army was gone. The only remnants of it was a giant crack in the terrain, the very force of the Elements tearing the land asunder with their magical power. Unfortunately for Equestria, the Elements of Harmony vanished along with Umbra and Chrysalis, presumably tearing throughout the cosmos somewhere else.\n\nThe time of rebuilding afterwards was peaceful, and gradually, over the course of many, many, many years, Equestria soon grew to cover the entirety of Equis. Peace, Order, and Harmony were established world wide, and a new cultural and scientific revolution began. With Princess Luna at the helm of research, she lead the ponies of Equestria up into the stars, landing the first non-alicorn on the moon and eventually establishing the first extra-planetary mining stations within the system. During this, Celestia lead on the ground, helping the arts and other sciences flourish under her guidance.\n\nPrincess Celestia's rule grew stronger during this time, and along with the help of Luna, many artificial satellites were established, and ponies now had a presence on almost every planetary body within their home system. Luna had done the research, the exploration, but Celestia had made all of that possible.\n\nNow Celestia continues to lead, guiding the ponies of equestria out of their birth-place and onto other worlds, and out to explore distant and fascinating stars, all with the help of the Hyperdrive and the discovery of the Hyperlane Network."

START_SCREEN_imperium_crystalis:0 "Queen Umbra had been slumbering in the shadows for a very long time, waiting patiently for the right moment to make her grand return. The Equestrians had thought that she was long dead, and had placed two disgusting ponies in charge of her once great empire. The Queen watched and waited for centuries, letting her rage, her fury build up slowly over the years. Her magic was stronger than ever, and when the Princesses grew complacent, Queen Umbra made her move. Coming back to the world in a new and stronger form, she stormed the Crystal City and stole the Crystal Heart.\n\nThere she solidified her rule, enslaving the two weaklings who were placed in charge of her lands and dominating the very minds of the Crystal Ponies once more. She forced them to work in the crystal mines and created her own caste of soldiers, brainwashing them to be loyal only to her. The Crystal Empire was safely back in the hands of it's rightful ruler, and the Queen was able to mobilize her new armies for the great war against Equestria.\n\nIn the Badlands, the vile changelings had also risen back up, lead by Queen Chrysalis. Queen Umbra saw an opportunity in this, so she hid her disgust long enough to actually work with the changelings, and together the two nations invaded Equestria. Each day they took more and more land, cutting down the defenses of Equestria and breaking it's armies over iron blades and chitin.\n\nThe final battle of the war happened not long after, with the two massive armies of the Crystal Empire and the Changeling Swarm easily tearing their way through the weak Equestrians, they had made their way to the capital city of Canterlot. There the Equestrians made their last stand, fighting valiantly against the hordes of Changelings and the mighty legions of Umbra. The siege lasted for years, with only the magic of the princesses keeping the ponies in Canterlot safe from their inevitable death.\n\nEventually though, that had to come to an end. Something had happened to the barrier that the princesses had created, whether it was a small crack in the great shield, a lapse in control of one of the princesses, or simply the overwhelming power of the invading armies, and the shielding had broke. Within minutes Changelings and Crystal Ponies stormed into the streets, tearing apart soldiers and enslaving those they could. When Umbra and Chrysalis walked into Canterlot Palace together, they fought a great battle against Princess Luna and Princess Celestia. The clash between the four of them rocked the very earth, tearing apart the mountains that Canterlot had been founded on and creating massive craters in the earth with each blow against each other. By the end of the titanic engagement, only Umbra remained. Umbra and Chrysalis had fought the two Princesses to a standstill, and they had ultimately ended the lives of those immortals. After the battle Chrysalis was left weakened, having used up most of her Love and magical energy in that battle, which Umbra quickly took advantage of. She killed the Queen of the Changelings with nothing but a smirk on her face and slaughtered the Changeling army that sat in Canterlot.\n\nIn the thick of the fighting, the two Princesses had used the Elements of Harmony a great deal. Umbra had searched for them frantically when the battle was over, but all she could find was faint remnants of where they had gone. In a last bid attempt to keep Umbra from becoming too powerful, the Princesses had casted the Elements of Harmony up into the stars at random, putting them far out of reach of Queen Umbra.\n\nAnd thus the reign of Dark Imperator Umbra began. She ruled over the entirey of Equis with an iron fist, enslaving many of the Equestrians, conquering what had remained of the Griffon Kingdoms, and killing off whatever was left of the Changelings in the Badlands. Once she had taken over the entire world, her lust for power had turned her attention towards the stars.\n\nThe greatest minds of the Imperium Crystalis pooled their collective knowledge together to study the stars and establish their Dark Imperators rule over distant worlds. The discovery of the Hyperlane Network pushed these great ponies forwards, where they eventually created the first Hyperdrive. Now with the means to travel the stars, Umbra leads her loyal slaves and soldiers out into the great void in her search for even greater power, and to find the Elements of Harmony.\n\nFor the Dark Imperator."

The only remnants of it was a giant crack in the terrain, the very force of the Elements tearing the land asunder with their magical power. Unfortunately for Equestria, the Elements of Harmony vanished along with Umbra and Chrysalis, presumably tearing throughout the cosmos somewhere else.\n\nSomething inside of Celestia's mind cracked that day. The normally peaceful and loving Princess secluded herself away within her chambers for a long time after that war, leaving Luna to rule Equestria and rebuild it all by herself. Celestia's self imposed isolation lasted for a few months and by the end of it, she came out a changed mare. She had grown cold and hateful, and after a short fight with her sister, it was revealed that the mare that was once Celestia was no more.\n\nWhat took Celestia's place was something different, something more than just a mere alicorn. In Celestia's poor mental state, her magic and mental defences were lowered. The grief over all of those losses she felt made her weak and vulnerable, so something slithered it's way into Canterlot Palace. Something much like Nightmare Moon whispered into Celestia's mind, slowly persuading her to it's side, convincing her that taking direct control of Equestria was the only way to ensure peace, to prevent any greater bloodshed. Celestia listened to this voice and over the few months that she was alone, it corrupted her mind. The voice fully cemented itself inside of Celestia's mind fully and had even given her a new name, Daybreaker.\n\nWithin days Luna was banished straight to the moon again through the sheer power of Daybreaker's magic, and right after Daybreaker began taking over the entirety of Equestria. The weak nation could do nothing to stop her, so they all submitted to her rule, and eventually, they grew used to the iron fist she ruled with. She turned friends of Equestria into enemies, convincing the public that the creatures that they once called friends were only monsters who wanted to end all of Ponykind.\n\nSo with the blessing of her people, Daybrear set out on a great crusade against every sentient creature that didn't bend to her will. The changelings were squashed into a paste, the griffons were turned into mince meat for Equestrian live stock, and the dragons were all slaughtered to the last. By the end of it all Equestria had grown fanatically loyal to Daybreaker. Her twisted mind reveled in her new found power and before too long ponies were worshipping Daybrear as a god empress.\n\nThrough Daybreakers magic, the Hyperlane Network was discovered, interlinking the stars and putting all of creation within the Solar God Empresses reach. The first Hyperdrive was developed soon after, and from then on Daybreaker has been leading her fanatic followers into the stars to spread her rule, to ensure that the followers of the Empress would be the only thing left living within creation."

EMPIRE_DESIGN_imperiumcrystalis_desc:0 "The Imperium Crystalis lives by the rule of strength, and that the weak should fear the strong. Those who aren't strong enough, either physically or magically, are forced to work for the Queen. Lesser minds are dominated by dark magics and chained, forever forced by the dark Queen Umbra for the great good of the Imperium. Dissent is crushed as soon as it appears and no one dares to question Queen Umbra, less they face a fate worse then death. something."
